                    <p>
                        I am Donaldo Ayala (<i>aka Donny</i>) and I'm a Computer Engineering 
                        student at <a href="https://www.escom.ipn.mx/"></a> who loves 
                        programming.
                        I like everything about computers, I like how they are built, 
                        how they work, and the wide variety of things you can do with 
                        them. I am into competitive programming as well as software 
                        development and recently an interest for web developement was 
                        born in me ‚ù§.

                    This system consists of a mobile app and a web app to improve 
                    current management of GrandVision's warehouse. It provides the 
                    user with an automated application for the distribution of products
